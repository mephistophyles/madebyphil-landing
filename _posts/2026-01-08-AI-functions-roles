title: "AI will replace roles, augment functions and thus create new roles"

AI will replace a lot of current roles within functions by being able to deliver on the output that most of those roles contribute to the overall organization. It will change how a lot of functions operate within a company too, and in doing so it will create new roles. 

Functions in most organizations are not going to change a lot unless the fundamental dynamics of companies and the economy change, which I don't think likely in the short term. Marketing still needs to find ways to connect our offering to people who would benefit from it. Sales still needs to help customers in their purchasing decision and build trust. Product (in the largest sense, including engineering) still needs to build an offering that fulfills our customers' needs in a way that is secure, trustworthy, reliable, extensible, etc. Support still needs to help where the previous functions fall short. This tells me the *how* of the functions will change, but the true outcomes will not.

A major challenge is going to be figuring out how to map the old roles to the new ones.  This is not just for individuals to navigate, for people who want to find a new job and become future proof and AI-ready or whatever we're calling it. It's also something that organizations should start thinking about because as each functions evolves, the way it delivers on its purpose is going to change, and this will affect the way they staff (in the sense of how many people in what roles they need). So we need to be ready with role descriptions that match the short-term, but also evolve.  

Most importantly we need the right descriptions of success and the right tactical outcomes that they need to drive. We must give people the skills they need, and the training they need, and the enablement they need to be successful in those functions. We need to promote a culture of experimentation and learning because those will help the organization become future proof (and by helpful extension do the same for our employees).

What's important to realize is that this isn't new. Job descriptions have always evolved and roles have changed. The shift will certainly be more radical and faster in places, but the exact dynamics are no different.
