I'm moving all my blog posts to Jekyll, stay tuned as this list populates. 

I recently made the decision to take the plunge into the scary solo/entrepreneurial waters. I have a substack where I detail the goings on of that project (Mokkapi) - but I want to keep that focused on the specifics of that project. And over the years I have learned a lot and written some of it down - the rest I think I've forgotten or isn't immediately retrievable. 

One of the things I've learned recently is that we have massive tool bloat. The world has gotten immensely complex and there are tools to help with everything. This is all still manageable when there is a team whose full time job it is to maintain these tools (shout out to all the RevOps, MarOps, ProductOps, DevOps, and all the other ops teams). When you suddenly have to manage all that yourself you quickly take on a minimalist philosophy. So in that sense I am embracing defaults unless there is a VERY GOOD reason I want to deviate from that and accept the ongoing extra overhead to manage it.
