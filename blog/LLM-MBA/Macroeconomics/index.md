This comprehensive two-course structure provides both the theoretical foundations of macroeconomics and its modern applications to policy challenges. Macroeconomics I builds the core analytical frameworks and historical context, while Macroeconomics II explores contemporary models, policy debates, and emerging issues. The case discussions connect abstract theory to concrete historical episodes, helping you develop both conceptual understanding and applied intuition for executive decision-making.

The syllabus is designed with a technical background in mind, so it doesn't shy away from the mathematical underpinnings of modern macroeconomics, but it maintains a focus on the economic intuition and policy relevance that will serve you well in an executive MBA program.
